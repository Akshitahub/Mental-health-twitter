# project -BUILT IN COLLABRATION WITH LATIKA PANDEY
Sentiment Analysis of Mental Health Posts on Twitter

#Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sentiment trends in Twitter posts related to mental health. The goal is to explore sentiment patterns and evaluate various machine learning models to classify sentiments in these posts.

#Prerequisites
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (includes Jupyter Notebook)
- Python 3.x
  
#Key Responsibilities:
-Data Collection & Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared Twitter data using Pandas, including text cleaning to remove URLs, mentions, and irrelevant characters.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed word frequencies and sentiment trends using bar charts and histograms.
Visualized data with matplotlib and Seaborn to understand patterns in positive and negative sentiments.
-Feature Engineering & Model Training:
Applied feature scaling and noise injection to improve model robustness.
Implemented various classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN) and evaluated their performance.
Generated confusion matrices and classification reports to assess model accuracy.
-Results & Insights:
Identified key sentiment trends and correlations in Twitter posts.
Evaluated model performance and reported on accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
-Tools & Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Environment: Anaconda Navigator, Jupyter Notebook
